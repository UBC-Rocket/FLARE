In order to successfully poll the GPS, the serial RX buffer size must be
increased. This needs to be done on the computer used for compilation. This can
be done by navigating to the following path in the Arduino contents folder: On
Mac: Got to the Applications folder, right click on the Arduino app, select Show
Package Contents, then navigate to
‎⁨Contents⁩/⁨Java⁩/⁨hardware⁩/⁨teensy⁩/⁨avr⁩/⁨cores⁩/⁨teensy3⁩/serial1.c
On Windows: [user_drive]\Program Files
(x86)\Arduino\hardware\teensy\avr\cores\teensy3\serial1.c

On line 43 increase SERIAL1_RX_BUFFER_SIZE from 64 to 1024

THIS MUST BE DONE ON THE COMPUTER USED TO COMPILE THE CODE!!!
