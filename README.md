In order to successfully poll the GPS, the serial RX buffer size must be increased. This needs
to be done on the computer used for compilation. This can be done by navigating to the following
path in the Arduino contents folder: ‎⁨Contents⁩/⁨Java⁩/⁨hardware⁩/⁨teensy⁩/⁨avr⁩/⁨cores⁩/⁨teensy3⁩/serial1.c.
On line 43 increase SERIAL1_RX_BUFFER_SIZE from 64 to 128.
THIS MUST BE DONE ON THE COMPUTER USED TO COMPILE THE CODE!!!
